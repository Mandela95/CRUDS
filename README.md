# Javascript CRUDS Project - System Management

Live Demo: 

CRUD is an acronym for
C => Create - The create function allows users to create a new record in the database.

R => Read - The read function is similar to a search function. It allows users to search and retrieve specific records in the table and read their values. Users may be able to find desired records using keywords, or by filtering the data based on customized criteria.

U => Update - The update function is used to modify existing records that exist in the database. To fully change a record, users may have to modify information in multiple fields.

D => Delete - The delete function allows users to remove records from a database that is no longer needed.

S => Search - Search whatever you want to check the amount of stock by title name or category.
